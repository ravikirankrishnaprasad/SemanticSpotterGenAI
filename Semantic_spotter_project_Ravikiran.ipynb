    "#### Problem Statement: \n",
    "Building a RAG-based Generative Search System for Insurance Policy Documents\n",
    "The insurance industry generates vast amounts of policy documents containing complex and extensive details. Customers and agents often struggle to retrieve specific information efficiently, leading to delays in decision-making and increased dependency on manual customer support.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to ask natural language queries and receive accurate, context-aware responses derived from insurance policy documents. By leveraging LLMs (Large Language Models) with advanced retrieval mechanisms, the system will improve the efficiency of document search, reduce customer service overhead, and enhance user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will utilize LangChain or LlamaIndex to integrate retrieval-based search with generative AI capabilities. It will process and index various insurance policies, allowing users to extract precise answers instead of scanning lengthy documents manually."
