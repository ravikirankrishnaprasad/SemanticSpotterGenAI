# RAG-based Generative Search System for Insurance Policy Documents

## Overview
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** to efficiently retrieve information from insurance policy documents using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The system enables users to ask natural language queries and receive accurate, context-aware responses generated from insurance policies.

## Problem Statement
Insurance policies contain extensive details, making it difficult for users to retrieve specific information quickly. Traditional keyword-based search is inefficient, requiring users to manually scan through large documents. This project addresses these challenges by integrating **document retrieval mechanisms with generative AI**, providing precise answers based on policy documents.

## Approach
The system follows the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture**, combining:
- **Document Retrieval**: Extracts the most relevant sections from policy documents.
- **LLM-powered Text Generation**: Uses an AI model to generate coherent, context-aware responses.

## Features
âœ… Efficient document ingestion (PDF, DOCX, TXT parsing)  
âœ… Advanced text preprocessing (tokenization, cleaning)  
âœ… Intelligent retrieval of relevant policy sections  
âœ… Natural language processing for user queries  
âœ… Integration with OpenAI's GPT for response generation  

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for implementation  
- **LangChain / LlamaIndex**: Handles document indexing and retrieval  
- **OpenAI GPT API**: Generates responses based on retrieved content  
- **PyPDF, docx2txt**: Parses policy documents  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development and testing environment

```

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/RAG-Insurance-Search.git
   cd RAG-Insurance-Search
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the project in a Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

## Usage
- Upload insurance policy documents (PDF/DOCX/TXT).  
- Enter a natural language query related to policy terms.  
- The system retrieves relevant sections and generates a precise response.  

## Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Enhance retrieval with vector embeddings (FAISS, ChromaDB)  
ðŸ”¹ Improve LLM fine-tuning for insurance-specific queries  
ðŸ”¹ Deploy as a web-based chatbot or API service
